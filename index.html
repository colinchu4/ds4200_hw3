        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my webiste! My name is Colin Chu and I am a junior student studying Data Science and 
            Mathematics at Northeastern. In this website, I will share some parts of my Mahjong journey 
            since I moved to the US.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and I moved to New York in 2020 when I was 15. When I lived in 
            Hong Kong, I used to visit my cousins and grandparents who lived in New York every summer, and I'd 
            watch my mom play Mahjong with my aunts and Grandma all the time, and I was always interested. I played
            occassionally with my parents and my brother in Hong Kong, but never too seriously. Then when I started
            going to college, my friends wanted to learn how to play Mahjong and I also wanted to get back into playing,
            so when I moved off-campus I bought a mahjong table and a set of tiles. Ever since, I've had weekly
            Mahjong nights at my apartment, and we always have groups of people come over to play and talk. I also started
            finding and bringing friends to Mahjong events and parlors hosted in New York. I find Mahjong to be a great 
            activity to slow down on the weekends and catch up with some friends, and sometimes I think this bit of
            fresh air is much needed to help us out!
