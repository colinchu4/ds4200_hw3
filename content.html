    <p>Here is a time my friends and I played over at my apartment. This is a photo of one of the best hands I won
        that night. In Mahjong you have to
        form a hand to win, and each hand consists of blocks of 3 sets. These sets could either be three of the same
        tile, or a 'straight' (eg. 1, 2, 3). A winning hand not only consists of all completed blocks of three with
        one pair, you also need a minimum of 1 point to win (at least the version I play with my friends). An example
        of a way of getting a point would be if your hand had all 'straights' (with a pair), and some hands earn
        more points than others. This hand I won is called '清一色', which means a hand of all of the same suit. This 
        hands earns SEVEN WHOLE POINTS (a lot of money if we were betting), so I was very proud of myself. I remember
        my friends were also playing some pretty high-energy music and it was getting pretty competitive, so me winning
        a big hand here basically sealed me as first place for the night.

    <p class="angry_text">I also have a half-eaten pineapple bun on my lap. However, please do not eat while playing
        Mahjong or any kind of games. Remember to stay hygenic and wash your hands regularly.

    <p>This day I took my girlfriend to a Mahjong social event in Brooklyn New York. It seems like Mahjong
        has been getting pretty popular to a point where groups book venues and host events for people to 
        play and meet people. This venue also served some fancy cafe drinks, including Salted Vietnamese coffee and 
        Earl Grey Matcha Lattes, which I have to say were way better than the average overpriced NYC cafe. Even 
        though my girlfriend doesn't know how to play, they had a short coaching session for beginners before they
        hopped around tables. Overall this was an amazing experience, though most of the people were here to socialize
        and hang out rather than to play and win.
