Styling & Customizations: \
Card: I created a card class for the introduction and contact sections of my home page, including a grey (smokewhite) background with the Garamond font with a black border and custom margins. \
Image container: I had an image container class which wraps around images (and captions) to center them and add margins.
Green button: I had a green button class in the home page after the introduction and image to take you to the same journal entry/content page with custom borders, margins, colors etc.d
Angry text: I had a custom text class that made text red and bold.
